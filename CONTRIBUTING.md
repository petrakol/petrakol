## Metrics workflow

Dynamic visualisations are generated by `.github/workflows/metrics.yml` with [lowlighter/metrics](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics).

### How it works

- Workflow runs every 6 hours (`0 */6 * * *`), on `workflow_dispatch`, and on pushes to `main`.
- Each job writes SVG outputs (overview, languages, contributions, streak, repositories) to the `output` branch.
- README embeds those SVGs from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petrakol/petrakol/output/metrics/*.svg`.

### Update cadence, theme, and plugins

1. Open `.github/workflows/metrics.yml`.
2. Edit shared env values:
   - `METRICS_TEMPLATE`
   - `METRICS_THEME`
   - `METRICS_TIMEZONE`
3. Adjust plugin settings in each generation step (for example `plugin_languages_*`, `plugin_stars_*`, `plugin_repositories_*`).
4. Commit to `main` and/or run **workflow_dispatch** from the Actions tab to regenerate cards immediately.

### README consistency rules

- Keep badge style as `for-the-badge`.
- Keep primary accent as LinkedIn blue (`#0A66C2`) unless a full visual refresh is planned.
- When adding new metric cards, use the same width/alignment pattern in the **GitHub Stats** section.
